# Markdown Projects

A CLI tool that stores your entire project — issues, milestones, docs — as plain markdown files in a `.mdp/` folder. No database, no server. Just files on disk that you can read, edit, and commit with git.

## All Data is Stored Locally as Files

```
project-root/
└── .mdp/
    ├── project.json
    ├── issues/
    │   ├── ISS-1-add-authentication/
    │   │   └── ISS-1-add-authentication.md
    │   └── ISS-2-database-schema/
    │       └── ISS-2-database-schema.md
    ├── milestones/
    │   └── M-1-v1-release/
    │       └── M-1-v1-release.md
    ├── docs/
    └── templates/
```

Each issue and milestone lives in its own folder. The folder can hold extra files — screenshots, design docs, logs — alongside the main markdown file.

## What's in a File

Every issue is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter for structured fields and a free-form body:

```markdown
---
id: ISS-2
title: Implement JWT tokens
type: task
status: In Progress
priority: High
labels:
  - backend
  - security
assignee: agent-1
milestone: M-1
checklist:
  - text: Access token generation
    done: true
  - text: Refresh token rotation
    done: false
---

Implement JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens.
```

See [Issues](/issues) for the full field reference, file naming rules, and all commands. [Milestones](/milestones) follow the same structure — grouping issues toward a shared goal.

## Designed for AI Agents

The CLI is non-interactive. All input comes from flags and stdin, all output is structured JSON. This makes it ideal for AI agents and automation that need to manage project state programmatically.

- **Markdown is the source of truth.** All project state lives in `.mdp/` as human-readable files.
- **Git-compatible by design.** File-per-issue storage means clean diffs, meaningful merge conflicts, and natural branch-based workflows.
- **Convention over configuration.** [Presets](/global-config#presets) populate your [configuration](/project-config) at project creation, so you can start immediately.

## JSON Output

All commands return a JSON envelope:

```json
// Success
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "warnings": []
}

// Error (written to stderr)
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ISSUE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Issue ISS-42 not found",
    "details": { "id": "ISS-42" }
  }
}
```

The `warnings` array contains non-fatal issues. Table format is available via `--format table`.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0`  | Success |
| `1`  | General error (invalid input, file not found, etc.) |
| `2`  | Project not found (no `.mdp/` directory) |

## Command Groups
